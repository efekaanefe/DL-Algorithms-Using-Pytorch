    "## Self-Attention\n",
    "Notes:\n",
    "- Attention is a **communication mechanism**. Can be seen as nodes in a directed graph looking at each other and aggregating information with a weighted sum from all nodes that point to them, with data-dependent weights.\n",
    "- There is no notion of space. Attention simply acts over a set of vectors. This is why we need to positionally encode tokens.\n",
    "- Each example across batch dimension is of course processed completely independently and never \"talk\" to each other\n",
    "- In an \"encoder\" attention block just delete the single line that does masking with `tril`, allowing all tokens to communicate. This block here is called a \"decoder\" attention block because it has triangular masking, and is usually used in autoregressive settings, like language modeling.\n",
    "- \"self-attention\" just means that the keys and values are produced from the same source as queries. In \"cross-attention\", the queries still get produced from x, but the keys and values come from some other, external source (e.g. an encoder module)\n",
    "- \"Scaled\" attention additional divides `wei` by 1/sqrt(head_size). This makes it so when input Q,K are unit variance, wei will be unit variance too and Softmax will stay diffuse and not saturate too much. Illustration below"
